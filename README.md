# StayEase Server

This is a server application built using IntelliJ IDEA and the Spring boot. It provides REST API endpoints for fetching, updating, deleting, and adding data to a Mysql database. The server utilizes various modern technologies including Data Jpa for Interacting with Database, JWT authentication, and JSON serialization for data handling.

## Technologies Used

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The primary IDE for server-side Java development.
- **JSON Serialization**: For handling JSON data in the server.
- **Spring Boot**: The primary framework used for building the backend of the application, enabling rapid development with minimal configuration.
- **Spring MVC**: Provides RESTful web services and manages routing of HTTP requests.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database operations and interaction with relational databases using the JPA specification.
- **MySQL Database**: Used for persistent storage of hostel data such as students, rooms, bookings, and staff.
- **Spring Security**: Ensures secure access with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **REST API**: Enables communication between the client and server, handling CRUD operations for various hostel entities
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code in model and service classes through annotations like @Getter, @Setter, and @Builder.
- **Maven/Gradle**: Manages project dependencies and build lifecycle.
